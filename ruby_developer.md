## Ruby developer, Copenhagen

Preadly is a small Danish startup, located right in the central heart of Copenhagen.

We’re a bunch of awesome guys, who are developing an awesome application.
We will reinvent the way readers and bloggers interact with each other.

We love to use the latest technologies, and are not affraid to take the time needed to learn them.

We need a full-time developer to help us build this kick-ass application, and more
importantly help us doing it faster!

You should be “startup-friendly” and be used to work in an informal environment.


### Technical stuff

The application is written in Ruby, mainly backed by Rails. Both the application
and the database is hosted as a service, so there will not be much dev-ops work.

The application is brand new, so you will have a lot of influence on the architecture.

You should have experience with:

 - Ruby
 - Ruby on Rails or another MVC framework


It would be an advantage if you also have experience with:

 - Writing APIs
 - Test Driven Development
 - MongoDB
 - Amazon Web Services
 - Angular, Backbone, Ember or similar
 - Git


You will be working in a small and casual development team, where only some
people are located in the Copenhagen office. Therefore you must be able to work
independently.

*We work hard and have fun!*
